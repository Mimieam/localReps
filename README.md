React + Electron + MotionUI + Glue... lots of Glue XD


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
and uses [Electron Prebuilt Compile](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-prebuilt-compile) to deal with ES6/7


if you have Electron Prebuilt Compile installed globally ( and not conflicting with electron... ) 
you can just run:

> electron myes6file.js

or if the prebuilt was installed locally ..

> node_modules/electron-prebuilt-compile/lib/cli.js electron.index.js
